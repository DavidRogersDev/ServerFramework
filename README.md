# ServerFramework
A small collection of libraries, opinionated in nature, which cut down on the amount of set-up code you need to write when starting a new ASP.NET Core Web Application.  
  
This repository will serve as an example application to underpin various articles which I intend to write about ASP.NET Core and some of the great libraries which you can use to build up a server-side framework to support your projects.
